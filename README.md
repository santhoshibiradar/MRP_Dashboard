# Employability Analytics Dashboard for Startups
> A Power BI dashboard to help startup founders make informed, data-driven hiring decisions with real-time insights into job trends, salary benchmarks, skill demands, and workforce dynamics.

## 📘 Project Description

Startups often struggle with hiring due to limited budgets, fast-changing markets, and a lack of clear data. This dashboard was built to empower startup founders and career advisors with actionable insights into job postings, candidate fit, salary ranges, and global hiring demand. The goal is to streamline recruitment, optimize compensation strategies, and support data-driven decision-making.

This project was developed as part of the Master's Research Project (MRP) at **Saint Louis University** under the mentorship of **Professor Maria Weber**.
